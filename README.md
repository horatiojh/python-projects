# python-projects

This is a folder for all my Python projects. I took an Intro class in Python, where we learned basic programming syntax, and really enjoyed it (it's such a powerful and simple language!) so I decided to pick up more skills individually and mess around. 

Below are the projects that I've created so far, along with a short write-up on what they do/represent. Enjoy! 

## Image Processor

I worked on this for one of the assignments in class, and found it quite interesting that we could edit the RGB values of a picture as these values were stored as an array, and looping over these values and editing them would allow us to apply cool filters and effects to these pictures. 

## ShareInvestor Simple Stock Market Scraper

This was a personal project after watching a Datascience Dojo Youtube video on [Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQgXKtPSzUI&t=1274s), and tried to scrape prices off the stock market for my investment spreadsheets. The idea was to be able to get a list of Stock Prices daily, and write them into a CSV file, so that I could just run the code then copy the contents of the CSV file into my Investment Spreadsheet, rather than having to go onto the individual stock profile pages and copying the data.
